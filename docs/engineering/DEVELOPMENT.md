# Development Environment

Status: authoritative
Last verified: 2026-08-28

Use `scripts/repo.py` through root npm commands. It derives a stable worktree ID,
Compose project, database port, and service ports without sharing state with
another worktree.

```bash
npm run repo:doctor
npm run repo:setup
npm run repo:up
```

The harness writes `.harness/runtime.json` and `.harness/runtime.env`; both are
untracked. Use `npm run repo:down` for normal teardown and `npm run repo:reset`
only when disposable database state may be removed.

Lower-level commands are diagnostic interfaces, not substitutes for the
canonical full check:

```bash
npm run dev:web
npm run dev:api
npm run lint:web
npm run test:api
```

## API dependency management

The API uses uv `0.12.7`. `apps/api/pyproject.toml` and `apps/api/uv.lock` are
the dependency source of truth. Repository setup and Docker dependency stages
use the locked uv file.

The only canonical local API environment is `<repository>/.venv`. Repository
tooling selects it explicitly, so do not create `apps/api/.venv` or require
shell activation. Stale environments are never deleted automatically.

After changing an API dependency, update and then check the lock file through
the root npm aliases:

```bash
npm run lock:api
npm run lock:check:api
```

To synchronize the development dependencies into the canonical root
environment, run:

```bash
npm run sync:api
```

The normal repository flow is:

```bash
npm run repo:doctor
npm run repo:setup
npm run repo:up
```

API runtime, migration, test, and build operations are exposed through the
root aliases `dev:api`, `migrate:api`, `test:api:fast`, `test:api:postgres`,
`test:api`, and `build:api`. Repository checks remain `npm run check:fast` and
`npm run check`.

## Minimal Makefile

The Makefile is not a second command surface. It contains only Unix/WSL
convenience shortcuts for the local PostgreSQL test server:

```bash
make test_db_up
make test_db_stop
```

The cross-platform equivalents are:

```bash
python scripts/repo.py test-db up
python scripts/repo.py test-db stop
```

Compose owns the PostgreSQL server/container and `repo.py` owns its
worktree-specific orchestration. pytest owns creation, migration, schema reset,
and teardown of the disposable `_tests` database; developers must not manually
create or drop the physical test database.

For PostgreSQL tests, configuration precedence is: explicit
`TEST_POSTGRES_DATABASE_URL`; complete explicit `POSTGRES_*_TEST` configuration
(partial configuration fails); then the current worktree runtime configuration
with its mapped host port and a derived `_tests` database name. Credentials are
read from the environment and are not documented here.

The normal Unix/WSL PostgreSQL flow is:

```bash
make test_db_up
npm run test:api:postgres
make test_db_stop
```

The complete backend flow uses `npm run test:api` in the middle. The
`test:api:fast` alias remains PostgreSQL-independent.
